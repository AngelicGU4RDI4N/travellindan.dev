			<h3>Swedish Massage</h3>
			<p>
				Swedish massage is the most common known type of massage. The primary aspect of a Swedish massage is to relax the individual. This is performed by providing long gliding strokes towards the heart to improve circulation.

				There are many different benefits to a Swedish massage. Not only does it increase circulation but also increases the level of oxygen in the blood, increases the immune system response, decreases toxins in the muscles and promotes flexibility.

				Due to the many different complication that the first term of pregnancy causes, I will not perform a prenatal massage on a woman during this time. Once the woman enters into the second trimester I will require a Doctor’s note saying that a massage is permissible.
