		<h2>Warning</h2>
		<p>
			Although massage is a great benefit and in some cases a luxury, there are times that one should not receive a massage. Although massage can help with some conditions it can also cause some conditions to be worsened. In some cases a Doctorâ€™s note will be required before receiving a massage. For further information please look over the contraindications page for what conditions a massage is not recommended.
