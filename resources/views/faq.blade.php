		<h3>Why do I get charged full price when I cancel within 3 hours?</h3>
		<p>
			The schedule can be fully booked and it ismuch harder to book a customer within 3 hours where there is no guarantee that spot will be filled intime for travel planning.
		</p>	
		<h3>What happens if I don’t like my massage?</h3>
		<p>
			Every person has the option to not use a specific massage therapist. There are many in the area to choose from. The touch one massage therapist uses is completely different from the touch of another massage therapist.
		</p>	
		<h3>What should I expect during a massage?</h3>
		<p>
			I am very professional. I intend to relax and fix muscles to help overall mind, body and soul. The massage itself depends on the person receiving the massage. No massage I give to one person will be the exact same as I give to another. My intentions are to relax the muscles and attempt to get rid of any trigger points, knots or strains that there may be.
		</p>		
		<h3>When is not a good time to schedule a massage? </h3>
		<p>
			Never is my response, however most people like a massage during the day or at the end of a long day. In some cases massage is not acceptable. 72 hours after a car accident, or if any main contraindications for massage are found. If you have a contraindication for massage, which can be found on the contraindications page, please have a signed Doctor’s note ready when I arrive saying you are allowed to receive a massage.
